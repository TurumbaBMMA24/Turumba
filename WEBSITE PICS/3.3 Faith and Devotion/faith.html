          <h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
          <p class="description1">
            In Pakil, expressions of gratitude shape the devotion to the Mahal na Birhen ng Turumba. Many devotees return to the Virgin not out of request, but out of thanks for prayers already answered. These gestures of thanksgiving are rooted in deeply personal experiences. People share how their wishes have come true, in the form of a long-awaited child, success in board exams, reconciliation between spouses, the chance to work abroad, or even victory in elections.
          </p>
          <p class="description1">
          
Each offering and thanksgiving tells a personal story of a fulfilled promise and affirms a continuing faith, reminding the community that answered prayers are worth returning to and celebrating.

              <p class="description1">
                Some devotees turn to the Our Lady of Turumba for protection in moments of fear and uncertainty. Many share similar stories of protection and miracles are woven into Pakil’s history:</p>
              <p class="description2">
                <br>&#8226; During the Second World War, townspeople believed that Pakil was spared from bombings when pilots reportedly saw a woman dressed in white standing atop the church, motioning for peace.
                <br>&#8226; Another tale tells of fourteen soldiers who survived in battle because each of them carried a small piece of the Virgin’s clothing.
                <br>&#8226; One local soldier was also said to have survived a tank explosion — the only survivor, protected, they say, by the same sacred cloth.
                <br>&#8226; One elder woman recalled how her husband, a soldier sent to war, became the center of her prayers. Every day she prayed for his safety. For two years, she even walked on her knees as an act of penance and unwavering devotion, entrusting his life entirely to the Virgin.

              </p>

<p class="description1">People also turn to the Turumba devotion for help in times of sickness and suffering. Through countless stories shared across generations, visitors come to Pakil and visit the Turumba hoping for healing, especially the elderly who pray for strength and better health. Acts of devotion such as helping carry the andas or offering flowers are done as part of their prayer request or plea for healing.</p>
           
<p class="description1">
  Several testimonies include recovery from stroke, children with disability began learning to walk again, and illnesses improving after praying to the Virgin. These stories continue to strengthen the community’s belief in the intercession of the Mahal na Birhen ng Turumba.

          <h2>Prayer Requests</h2>
          <p class="description1">
            Many devotees pray to the Mahal na Birhen ng Turumba for personal intentions, especially during important life moments. Acts of thanksgiving vary: some bring items representing their prayers, such as a suitcase or a small airplane figurine for overseas job opportunities, or flowers to express gratitude for having a child.
          </p>
          <p class="description1">
            Students and professionals commonly seek the Virgin’s help for academic and career success. Testimonies include passing the Licensure Examination for Teachers, law students completing the bar exam, and board exam results leading to careers in engineering, nursing, and other fields. Families often share images of the Virgin as a form of support for those preparing for major examinations.
          </p>
          <p class="description1">Other devotees pray for guidance and strength in their daily lives. One young person credited the Virgin’s intercession in helping him finish school despite mental and personal challenges. These accounts show how faith in the Virgin remains part of everyday goals and achievements, from education and work to family and well-being.</p>
        
          <h2 id="vows">Vows (Panata)</h2>
          <p class="description1">
            The act of vows or “panata” refers to a solemn promise or commitment made by devotees to the Our Lady of Turumba in return for her intercession or blessings. After praying and asking for the Virgin’s intercession, devotees often take part in the novenas (called lupi) and the street-dance processions during the festival period. These acts of participation serve as the visible fulfilment of the promise. People believe that when they fulfill their vow, the Virgin continues to guide and protect them.
          </p>
          <p class="description1">
            Some vow-makers return each year to the shrine to offer thanks, signaling that their request has been met or to reaffirm their devotion. Others express their vow through physical acts of devotion such as walking on their knees during the lupi, helping carry the andas, or serving in church activities.

              <p class="description1">
                Stories of protection and healing are closely linked to the act of making vows to the Virgin. These promises represent a personal relationship where devotees seek help while offering commitment in return.</p>
              <br>
                <p class="description1">
                In the Turumba devotion, this practice is known as “pag-ako”, which means taking a vow or responsibility before the Virgin. These forms the spiritual core of devotion in Pakil. When someone says “inaako ko,” they are expressing both a plea for assistance and a willingness to carry a burden, entrusting their fears, hopes, and struggles to the Virgin of Turumba.</p>
              <br>
                <p class="description1">
                The elder woman (pic above) shared that after experiencing eight months of paralysis, the loss of a child, and her husband being sent to war, she turned to the Virgin and vowed.
                </p>
                <br>
              <p class="description1">
                When she recovered, she fulfilled her vow, returning to Pakil and completing her promised act of devotion.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="description1">
                  Her story captures what “pag-ako” means in lived faith, a willingness to bear suffering and fulfill a vow as a form of trust and gratitude. Through pag-ako, faith becomes tangible: carried in the body, repeated in yearly acts, and remembered in every fulfilled promise.
