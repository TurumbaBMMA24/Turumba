                  <h2>Tourism and Local Economy</h2>
                  <p class="description1">The Turumba Festival plays a major role in boosting tourism and supporting the local economy. Every year, thousands of devotees and visitors travel to the town to join the celebration in honor of Our Lady of Sorrows. This large influx of people leads to an increase in spending within the community.</p>
          
                  <p class="description1">During the festival period, local businesses experience higher demand. Food stalls, restaurants, and sari-sari stores earn more as visitors look for meals and refreshments throughout the day. Vendors are given spaces near the church and along the procession routes which allows them to sell snacks, drinks, and other goods to participants. Many families also set up temporary stores outside their homes to take part in the economic activity.</p>

    <p class="description1">Accommodations such as lodging houses and homestays benefit as well. These establishments are often fully booked during major events like the Biyatiko. Tourists also explore nearby attractions including the Turumba swimming pool, which adds another source of income for the community.
    </p>
               
    <p class="description1">Religious products contribute to local sales too. Around the church plaza, vendors offer candles, rosaries, prayer booklets, holy oil, and other souvenirs connected to the devotion. These items are popular not only among devotees but also with tourists who bring them home as keepsakes.
    </p>
    
    
    
      <p class="description1">The local government and tourism sector support this economic growth by organizing programs, permits for vendors, and capacity-building seminars for businesses. These efforts help ensure that the festival is orderly while providing opportunities for residents to earn.

      </p>
    
      <p class="description1">Overall, the Turumba Festival strengthens the economy of Pakil by increasing tourism and supporting the livelihood of the community.
