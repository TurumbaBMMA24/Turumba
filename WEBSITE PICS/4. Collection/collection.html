                            The Turumba dance traces its roots to the “tatarin”, an early form of religious dance performed in honor of sacred images. According to local stories, the original Turumba had no fixed choreography; devotees simply danced freely in joy and devotion.
                          </p>
                          <p class="description1a">When Pakil was invited to perform at Nayong Filipino, Ka Iñigo Vito created a set of unified dance steps to accompany the song "Awit sa Turumba." These movements were designed to match the lyrics and rhythm of the hymn, forming the basis of the Turumba dance steps still performed today. While older generations recall the dance as more spontaneous and frenzied, it has since evolved into a coordinated expression of praise.

                                  The town of Pakil is home to four local bands: Banda Uno, Banda Dos, Banda Dose, and the newly formed Maestro Marcelo Adonay (MMA) Band. These bands play a vital role in the community, especially during the Turumba Festival, where they bring energy and spirit to every procession.

                                <p class="description1a">The bands also take part in the kampanaryo, held on the eve of each Turumba, where bells and bands alternate in performance for an hour, creating a festive call that signals tomorrow’s Turumba celebration.

                                        Music is defined as a vital element of the Turumba that accompanies the ritual dance and devotional activities. It is characterized by rhythmic drumbeats and traditional songs that set the pace and mood for both communal worship and celebration. Music in Pakil connects the community to their faith, enhances the ceremonial experience, and expresses collective joy and reverence for the Virgin Mary.
