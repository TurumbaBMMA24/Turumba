          <h2>Municipal Ordinances and Cultural Recognition</h2>
          <p class="description1">
            Based on Resolution No. 404, 2018, of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Laguna, it was approved on August 06, 2018, to officially recognize the town of Pakil, as the “Pilgrimage Capital of Laguna” for its religious and cultural significance, particularly its association with the Turumba Festival and devotion to Our Lady of Turumba.
          </p>
          <p class="description1">
            Cultural preservation is embedded in Pakil’s municipal development plan. Music, arts, and cultural programs are consistently included in Pakil’s mission and vision, ensuring that the town’s traditions are actively promoted. All Turumba-related activities, including music, art workshops, and street performances, emphasize the culture and history of Pakil, aligning with broader efforts to safeguard and institutionalize its intangible heritage.

              <h2>Church Initiatives</h2>
              <p class="description1">
                The St. Peter of Alcantara Parish Church, designated as the Diocesan Shrine of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Turumba, preserves
                the history and devotion of the Turumba through archival materials, including photographs, books, and other historical documents, many of which are housed in the Turumba Museum. This serve as sources for research on the Turumba and the history of the church.
              </p>
              <p class="description1">
                Oral histories and stories from longtime devotees and elder residents are actively collected and recorded to strengthen historical documentation, especially as firsthand accounts become harder to obtain due to the passing of older generations. These accounts are recorded through written notes, audio recordings, or digital formats.
              </p>
              <p class="description1">
                All collected materials are published on the official Facebook page, the Turumba Shrine, to share and provide the public with access to the history and devotion of Turumba. The church also conducts outreach programs, such as “Dalaw Turumba,” which involves visiting and promoting the devotion to Our Lady of Turumba in communities beyond Pakil.

                  <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
                  <p class="description1">
                    The older generation of Pakil actively entrusts the youth with preserving and  carrying forward the Turumba traditions. Young people are taught how to decorate the andas, sing the traditional songs, and participate in the various rituals of the festival. Media initiatives, such as the parish’s Media Ministry, help document and share these practices, ensuring its continuity and wider dissemination.
                  </p>
                  <p class="description1">
                    Traditions are also passed down within families, as children accompany their parents, grandparents, and relatives to the festival from an early age. This intergenerational participation allows the devotion to grow, not only within Pakil but also among visitors from other towns. The active involvement and engagement of the youth ensures that the cultural and religious practices remain active in sustaining the heritage of Pakil.

                        Advances in transportation have made participation the Turumba Festival more accessible. In the past, devotees often walked long distances and/or relied on hired vehicles, but today, modern transport services from Manila and nearby areas facilitate easier travel to Pakil.

                      <p class="description1">
                        
                        Technology and social media have significantly expanded awareness and participation in the Turumba. Mass media coverage, parish pages, and social media accounts such as “Turumba Shrine,” “Pakil Tourism, History, Culture and Arts-Turumba Festival” and the Social Communication Commission of Dambana ng Pakil allow devotees to learn about the festival, its schedule, and highlights. Even those unable to attend in person can follow live broadcasts of the Turumba Procession and Festival, ensuring continuous engagement with the devotion.
