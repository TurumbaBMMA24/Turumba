          <h2>Seven Novenas or Lupi</h2>
          <p class="description1">
            The Lupi is a seven-day novena that takes place before the feast of Our Lady of Turumba. The term comes from the Filipino word lupi, which the Diksyunaryo ng Wikang Filipino defines as “a folded and sewn part of cloth.” This definition metaphorically reflects how the locals perceive the novena as a “folding” or completion of a spiritual cycle of prayer and devotion.
          </p>
          <p class="description1">
            The celebration of Lupi is based on the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary, symbolized by the seven daggers that pierce her heart. These sorrows are remembered through seven major feast days observed throughout the Lenten and Easter seasons:

              <p class="description1">
                Each of these celebrations commemorates one of the seven sorrows of the Virgin Mary:</p>
              <p class="description2">
                <br>&#8226; First: When Mary presented her Son in the temple and heard Simeon’s prophecy of His suffering.
                <br>&#8226; Second: When the Holy Family fled to Egypt to protect the Child Jesus from King Herod.
                <br>&#8226; Third: When the young Jesus was lost for three days and later found in the temple.
                <br>&#8226; Fourth: When Mary met her Son carrying the Cross to Calvary.
                <br>&#8226; Fifth: When Christ was crucified and died on the Cross.
                <br>&#8226; Sixth: When His lifeless body was taken down from the Cross and laid in Mary’s arms.
                <br>&#8226; Seventh: When Jesus was laid in the tomb.
              </p>

<p class="description1">These seven events are remembered through seven successive celebrations beginning with Viernes de Dolores (the Friday before Palm Sunday) and concluding on Pentecost Sunday.</p>
           
<p class="description1">Due to the number of pilgrims and devotee attendees from nearby towns and provinces, other additional Lupi fiestas were introduced.
</p>

<p class="description2">
  <br>&#8226; Fiesta Pakileña occurs each May 12, in honor of the founding of the town of Pakil from Paete in 1676. Since it falls within the Lupi period, no separate novena is held.
  <br>&#8226; Piyestang Lagunense takes place on the Saturday before July 16, which is the feast of Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The province of Laguna was created on July 28, and the image of the Our Lady of Sorrows of Turumba was proclaimed “Patroness of the Lake” and “Promoter of the Region’s Environmental Stewardship” on July 30, 2016.
  <br>&#8226; Piyestang Pagkakaugnay usually falls every August 5, which is the Dedication of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome. The parish of St. Peter of Alcantara Parish Church in Pakil holds a Spiritual Bond of Affinity from the said Basilica. The other name of the feast refers to the Feast of the Transfiguration celebrated the next day.

  
  <p class="description1">During this extended season of devotion, countless devotees flock to Pakil to take part in the prayers, processions, and rituals that honor the sorrows and faithfulness of the Blessed Virgin of Turumba.</p>


  <h2>The Procession</h2>

  <p class="description1">After the Mass, the Turumba procession takes place. Many devotees believe that joining the procession brings healing or spiritual support. The procession is the main event that unites the entire community, with families joining together in a shared expression of faith and joy.</p>

  <p class="description1">Unlike the usual solemn and orderly processions, the Turumba is characterized by its festive atmosphere. There is no set choreography; people clap, dance, and move freely to the rhythm of the music, often striking their wooden clogs (bakya) together as an expression of joy and thanksgiving. The Turumba procession is inclusive to participants from all age groups within the community. From children to adults, the entire community takes part in honoring the Our Lady of Turumba.</p>

        <h2>Pagpapadamít ng Turumba</h2>
        <p>
          The tradition of dressing the image of the Virgin (Mahal na Birhen)
          has long been practiced in Pakil as an act of thanksgiving. Devotees
          offer new clothes to the Virgin in gratitude for answered prayers —
          such as recovering from illness, receiving blessings like having a
          child, passing the bar exams, or achieving milestones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many return to the town of Pakil to express their gratitude by
          sponsoring the Virgin’s clothing. This ritual of dressing the Turumba
          image reflects the people’s deep faith, devotion, and gratitude to
          the Blessed Virgin for her intercession.

    <h2>Reenactment of Turumba</h2>
    <p>
      About twenty years ago, the town of Pakil, Laguna revived the
      reenactment of the discovery of the sacred image of Our Lady of
      Sorrows in 1788. This event is held every September during Domingo de
      Dolores as part of the Turumba celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reenactment shows how the image was found along the shore of
      Laguna de Bay. Actors play the roles of fishermen and villagers,
      depicting scenes such as fishing on the lake, catching the sacred
      image in their nets, and dancing the Turumba in celebration. The
      people sing the “Awit sa Turumba” with a marching band, and devotees
      dance as the priest carries the image back to the church.

      <h2>Ahunan sa Mt. Ping-as</h2>
      <p class="description1">
        Ahunan sa Mt. Ping-as is an annual pilgrimage and community hike held every last Saturday of May in Pakil, Laguna, where residents and devotees climb to the summit of the mountain to attend mass, pray, and offer thanksgiving as a symbolic act of devotion and fulfillment of vows to the Our Lady of Turumba.</p>
      <p class="description1">
        
At its summit stands a large cross and a viewing deck where visitors can look out over Laguna de Bay, rice fields, and forested terrain. From there, people gather for a faith-centered ritual that includes a mass or devotional activity, followed by bathing or drinking from mountain springs that are believed to have healing or purifying qualities.</p>

            The trail to its summit starts with a paved cement road for a good portion, then leads to a steeper section of stairs before reaching the top where a large concrete cross stands as a landmark. Fronting the shrine are the altars, where the statue of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Turumba or simply called Turumba is prominently displayed.</p>
          </p><p class="description1">To help visitors learn about its background, marble plaques were placed on the site, each engraved with the history of the mountain. The inscription states:</p>
          
        </p><p class="description3">
              "During the Spanish period around 1671, a Franciscan priest, Fr. Francisco Solier, Kura of Paete, took a vow as a penitent to climb a mountain carrying a wooden cross.
            </p><p class="description3">
              Upon his death, the people of Pakil, out of greath respect, put up a wooden cross in this mountain in front of which they prayed the Holy Rosary and Santacruzan.
            </p> <p class="description3">
              In the belief that it cures ailments especially asthma, townsfolks cut out (“Pingas”) small portions of the cross
              to use as medicine. The place then came to be known as Pingas.
            </p><p class="description3">
              With the passage of the time, more and more people came to join the mountain climb. Stations of the Cross
              were placed along the trail.
            </p> <p class="description3">
              In 1966, the Pakil varsitarians constructed a concrete cross at Mt. Pingas. In 1986, the site was bought by the Macabasco Family and donated for the purpose.
            </p> <p class="description3">
              In October 1994, the cross was felled by a typhonn. B/Gen. Federico A. Macabasco, Col. Jose G. Hernandez and Councilor Iñigo G. Vito of the Pakil Mountaineers initiated the construction of a 35-foot concrete cross and chapel on the site. These were completed in October 1995 with the generous help of the people and friends of Pakil.
            </p><p class="description3">
              Consecrated on May 25, 1996 by Fr. Zaldy C. Fortuno, Parish Priest of Pakil.
          

<p class="description1">This practice became integrated into the larger Turumba tradition as a way for the faithful to express devotion, seek blessings, and maintain a tangible connection between faith, nature, and communal identity.       

<h2>Panghulo</h2>

<p class="description1">The Panghulo (also called the Turumba Swimming Pool) is a natural spring and bathing resort area located in Barangay Baño in Pakil, Laguna. Many devotees often visit the pool before going to church, guided by the belief that bathing in its water seven times can bring healing from illnesses.</p>

<p class="description1">A local story tells that the image of the Virgin Mary was reportedly seen walking on the water of the spring during a moonlit night. When devotees returned to the church, they noticed the Virgin’s clothes were miraculously wet, despite the image being untouched. Since then, the spring water has been regarded as miraculous.</p>

<p class="description1">Coming from a natural spring from the Sierra Madre mountains, the pool draws thousands of pilgrims, especially during the Turumba Festival, who seek its healing properties. Over time, the act of bathing in the Panghulo Pool has become a devotional ritual, performed by many as a gesture of faith and hope for physical or spiritual healing.
