          <h2>Faith and Identity</h2>
          <p class="description1">
            The Turumba devotion plays a central role in the social and cultural identity of Pakil. Locals say, “Pakil would not exist without the church.” Our Lady of Turumba is the main reason people visit the town, and her devotion continues to shape Pakil’s way of life.</p>
          
            <p class="description1">
              
St. Peter of Alcantara Parish Church, one of the oldest and best-preserved churches in the Philippines, stands as the heart of faith and tourism in Pakil. It is where the Turumba Festival is held, a celebration unique to the town because, unlike other festivals that honor products or trades, this one is purely religious in nature. In fact, it is recognized as the longest religious festivity in the Philippines, lasting for several months.
</p>
<p class="description1">
              
  
Today, the town is known for faith tourism. This connection is captured in the town’s tourism tagline: “Pakil: Where Fun Starts with Faith.” Pilgrims and visitors come not only to witness the Turumba procession but to pray, reflect, and experience the miracles believed to be granted by Our Lady of Turumba and the healing waters of the Panghulo.</p>

  <p class="description1">
              
    Even Pakileños living far from home remain spiritually connected to their roots. There is a local saying that when the church bells of Pakil ring, those from Pakil feel called to return.</p>

              <h2>Communinty Participation</h2>
              <p class="description1">
                Collective involvement is a key part of Pakil’s sacred traditions. Every religious activity, such as feasts and processions, is supported by the shared effort and devotion of the community. Those who take part in these sacred acts share a common form of religious commitment, embodied in the concept of “pag-akò.”
                <p class="description1">
                  The word “akò” refers to taking on or fulfilling a duty or responsibility on behalf of others, as reflected in related terms such as akuin (to assume), umakò (to take responsibility), pangako (promise), taga-akò (one who takes on), and pag-akò (the act of assuming responsibility).</p>
    <p class="description1">
      In practice, pag-akò in Pakil is not a matter of strict assignment but of voluntary initiative. People often step forward voluntarily without being asked, taking it upon themselves to help clean, organize, or prepare for church and community events. Locals also call this spirit of shared participation “atag,” where members of a group come together to perform tasks as an expression of faith and solidarity.
      <p class="description1">
                  
        Community cooperation extends beyond the church. Barangay officials, police officers, health workers, and civic volunteers all contribute to the safety and order of the celebrations. Families also provide financial assistance to support the festivities. These partnerships demonstrate how faith and civic responsibility unite in Pakil, strengthening both the spiritual and social fabric of the town.

              <h2>Community Roles in Turumba</h2>
              <p class="description1">
                The Turumba devotion is a community effort where everyone plays a part in keeping the tradition alive. Different groups work together to prepare, organize, and lead the celebrations throughout the year.
              </p>

              <p class="description1">
                Whether through prayer, music, dance, or helping in processions and events, each contribution strengthens both faith and unity in Pakil. This shows how the devotion is not just a religious celebration, but a shared responsibility and a living tradition passed from one generation to the next.
              </p>
          <p class="description1">Here are the groups who &nbsp;&nbsp;play an important role in the Turumba devotion:
          </p>
               <p class="description2">
                <span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Elders - </span>The elders help keep the Turumba devotion alive. They lead prayers, guide the youth, and pass down the traditions
                they learned from their own &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parents. Some of them also join the Turumba dance as a way to show their faith.
                <br><span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Youth - </span>The youth take an active part in the Turumba devotion. They carry small andas with the image of Our Lady of Turumba
                and dance while singing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the “Awit ng Turumba.” Their energy keeps the tradition alive, which is why locals say, “As long as there
                are children, there will be Turumba.”
                <br><span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Alagad ng Birhen - </span>The Alagad ng Birhen is a group of men who help take care of the image of Our Lady of Turumba.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carry the andas during processions and make sure everything runs smoothly. Some members also help organize 
              </p>
              <p class="description1">activities and support Turumba devotion in other communities outside Pakil.
              </p>
              <p class="description2">
                <span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Recamadoras - </span>The Recamadoras are the women entrusted with dressing and adorning the image of the Turumba. They perfume, pray over, and carefully
                &nbsp;&nbsp;clothe the image before every Turumba celebration. This group of women forms a special church organization devoted to the care and presentation of the &nbsp;&nbsp;image, ensuring that she is properly dressed in each celebration.
                <br><span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Turumba Dancers - </span>The Turumba dancers lead the people in joyful movement during the festivities. They inspire others to join in the dancing and singing that &nbsp;&nbsp;characterize the Turumba procession. Dressed in traditional Filipino attire, these dancers accompany the image of the Virgin, expressing faith and thanksgiving &nbsp;&nbsp;through their synchronized and lively performance.
                <br><span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Media Ministry - </span>The Media Ministry, composed mostly of young people, helps announce and promote Turumba activities to the wider community. Through &nbsp;&nbsp;their efforts, many devotees from other towns learn about upcoming events and are encouraged to visit Pakil or join in prayer during these occasions. They &nbsp;&nbsp;play an important role in preserving the devotion’s visibility and continuity in the digital age.
                <br><span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226; Liturgical Music Ministry - </span>The Liturgical Music Ministry serves to glorify God and sanctify the faithful through sacred music. The group prepares hymns, &nbsp;&nbsp;organizes musicians, and maintains the church’s small orchestra. Their performances enhance the solemnity of the Mass and the spiritual atmosphere of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Turumba celebrations.
                <br><span class="descriptioncolored">&#8226;Civic Organizations and Local Government - </span>The civic groups and local government works closely with the parish to plan, secure, and support every procession &nbsp;&nbsp;and public event. They provide crowd management, safety measures, and logistical needs such as road closures, medical assistance, and coordination with &nbsp;&nbsp;neighboring towns.
