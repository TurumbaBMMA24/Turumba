          <h1>Discovery of the Painting</h1>
          <p class="description2">
            The origin of the Turumba started on one Friday in September of 1788, when local fishermen discovered an oil painting of the Virgin Mary floating on the waters of Laguna de Bay. It was the image of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows).
          </p>
    
          <p class="description2">
            According to the legend, the fishermen considered bringing the image to a nearby town. However, as they sail, the strong winds
            and shifting currents made it difficult to maintain their course.
          </p>
    
          <p class="description2">
            After struggling, the current eventually carried their boat smoothly toward the shore near the town of Pakil. Upon landing, with the sun beginning to set, they left the image on a rock before departing.

        <div class="text-section2">
          

          <p class="description2">
            A group of women found the image the following Sunday morning. Despite the rain the previous night, the icon remained miraculously dry. When they tried to move it, the image was heavy and no layperson could lift it. Not even the strongest woman named Mariangga, was able to do so. They then decided to inform the parish priest, Padre Miguel Soriano, who came to the site along with sacristans, choir members, and churchgoers to retrieve the image.
          </p>
    
          <p class="description2">
            
            As the congregation lifted the image, the people around began to clap, sing, and dance. To their surprise, the image gave way, and the people continued to prance as it was carried to the church. This miraculous event led the people to commemorate the tradition of Turumba.
          </p>
    
          <p class="description2">
            This account of the image’s discovery has been passed down through generations and documented in several written sources.
            It appears in books discussing the history of the Turumba and continues to be recited during the celebration of Turumba in Pakil.

          <p class="description1">
            There are two versions of the legend surrounding the origin of the Turumba.<br>
One version was written by Ananias B. Isorena, and the other was from Iñigo G. Vito.

                  <p class="subtitle2">The Turumba began when a group of women danced and sang after discovering the framed image of the Virgin (Birhen) by the seashore. It is said that their clapping and leaping movements made the frame easier to carry, which had initially been too heavy for them.

          <h2>Other Versions</h2>
          <p class="bdescription1">
            One version says that although the framed image of the Virgin drifted against the waves, it was still found on the shore the next morning by fishermen resting on a large rock. The story continues that the frame could not be lifted from the wide stone because it was extremely heavy, but when the people began shouting “Magturumba tayo!” and “Sa Birhen!” the frame suddenly became light. From this, they were able to bring the frame to the church.
          </p>
          <p class="bdescription1">
            Another version tells that the framed image of the Virgin was unexpectedly caught in a fishermen’s net. But whenever they tried to carry it to shore to bring to the church, it would slip and fall, making it impossible to lift. When the fishermen eventually reached the shore of Pakil and the children saw the image of the Virgin, they shouted “Sa Birhen!” Because of this, the frame became lighter and the fishermen were able to bring it to the church.
          </p>

          <p class="bdescription1">
            The miraculous day of September 15 is considered the first Turumba in Pakil, Laguna. As time passed, this miracle was followed by many more accounts of wonders attributed to the Virgin of Turumba, shaped by the testimonies of the people of Pakil.

              <p class="bdescription2">
                The iconic image of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Turumba (Our Lady of Sorrows) is a portrayal of the Virgin Mary depicted on a 9x11 inches oil painting on canvas.

              <p class="bdescription2">
                This Marian image shows the face of the weeping Virgin Mary in deep sorrow, with a dagger pierced directly at her heart. This imagery references the Prophecy of Simeon where he mentioned that Mary would suffer greatly as her son, Jesus, would endure suffering and death on the Cross.

              <p class="bdescription2">
                The original painting is framed in wood and decorated with silver filigree. Today, the framed image is encased in glass and enshrined in a dedicated chapel located on the second floor of the Saint Peter of Alcantara Parish Church.

              <p class="bdescription2">
                The story adds that with the persistence of the people of Pakil, and with the help of a highly respected bishop, the original image was brought from Spain, where it was known as Nuestra Señora de las Antiguas.
              </p>
        
              <p class="bdescription2">
                
                Since it was better to use a true statue than just a small framed image for procession, the image from Spain has since been used during Turumba.
              </p>
        
              <p class="bdescription2">
                The statue is dressed in silk garments and adorned with gold jewelry, diamonds, and other precious stones. It is kept inside a glass case measuring around five and a half feet, surrounded by flowers offered by devotees such as roses, sampaguita, orchids, chrysanthemums, and anthuriums. Violet flowers are commonly used, especially during the first Turumba or Biyernes de Dolores.
              </p>
    
              <p class="bdescription2">
                Today, violet orchids, white dendrobium orchids, and sterling hazel flowers are often prepared for the Virgin. Devotees from nearby towns may take some of these flowers from the carriage, dry the petals, and keep them as personal relics. Some mix the dried petals with oil or hot water as a traditional remedy for minor ailments.

                    <h2>Defining the Word ‘Turumba’</h2>
                    <p class="bdescription1">
                      The word ‘Turumba’ is believed to have undergone various interpretations over time, possibly due to determine its etymology, its true essence, or meaning of this term. According to the book of Turumba sa Birhen Maria de los Dolores (1997), the term ‘Turumba’ has been interpreted as a state of being out of oneself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bdescription1">
                      The term ‘Turumba’ is derived from the Spanish-Portuguese word tarum (along with other related variants such as “taruru,” “tururo,” “turum,” or “tarumba”), which refers to a state of being “nahihibang” (delirious), “nawawala sa sarili” (out of oneself), or “hindi alam ang ginagawa sa sobrang tuwa” (acting involuntarily due to overwhelming joy).

                                In today’s Turumba, this kind of “loss of self” no longer occurs. But rather, the implication of the Filipino phrase "natumba sa laki ng tuwa" or tremble in great joy. During the procession, devotees of the Virgin are mostly seen dancing, jumping, and clapping.

                                According to Respeto (2024), some young participants now include familiar dance trends they watch on television, especially when the Turumba music shifts into a waltz or marching style. During observations in Pakil in 2001 and Intramuros in 2002, the youth were seen incorporating popular dance moves with the upbeat Turumba chant.

                                  In this context, the “loss of self” in the devotion might still be present. Instead of entering a trance-like state, participants express it through cheerful and energetic movement. As the music becomes livelier, they may unconsciously go beyond the traditional jumps and claps, becoming fully immersed in dance and celebration with Turumba.
